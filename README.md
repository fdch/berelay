A multichannel delay network based on the lorenz system of equatons, with an extra random twist, and presets you can play around with. It is intended for live performance with a line input (guitar or other). `berelay` is entirely made in Pure Data and uses `fd_lib` and `timbreID`, both avaliable via `Help>Find Externals`
